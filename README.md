## Rkt_FlexibleHead
In most of the cases, it is impossible to include a `page/html_head type` block inside head block (which is also a `page/html_head type` block). Using this extension, you can use a custom block `rkt_flexeblehead/page_html_head` block type in your layout file which has all of the power of `page/html_head` type block, but without causing any problems.
